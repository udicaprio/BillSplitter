# BillSplitter

### What is BillSplitter?
BillSplitter is a python-based package to split the bills between people. Given a group of people, you can: <p>
* Make one person pay and the bill will be egually splitted among all the people within the group.
* Make one person pay and the bill will be egually splitted among only some appointed people in the group.
* Visualize the due amount of all the people in the group

### How can I contribute?
Pull requests are always welcome. The next features I would like to implement are:
- [ ] Visualize the due amount of every person to whom
- [ ] Indicate the amount payed by every people in the bill and taking into account while splitting
- [ ] A nice logo is always welcome ðŸ˜Š

In addition, you can help me in writing the documentation of the project.
